                If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
                And I can take you for a ride
                I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
                Where the music don't stop for life
                Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
                Shining just the way I like
                If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
                You met me at the perfect time 

                You want me, I want you, baby
                My sugarboo, I'm levitating
                The Milky Way, we're renegading
                Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

                I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
                I need you all night, come on, dance with me
                I'm levitating
                You, moonlight, you're my starlight (you're the moonlight)
                I need you all night, come on, dance with me
                I'm levitating

                I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
                I see us written in the stars
                We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never, baby
                Nothing's ever, ever too far
                Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
                Shining just the way we are
                I feel like we're forever, every time we get together
                But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

                You want me, I want you, baby
                My sugarboo, I'm levitating
                The Milky Way, we're renegading

                My love is like a rocket, watch it blast off
                And I'm feeling so electric, dance my arse off
