                Oh, ey
                You don't know babe
                When you hold me
                And kiss me slowly
                It's the sweetest thing
                And it don't change
                If I had it my way
                You would know that you are
                You're the coffee that I need in the morning
                You're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring
                Won't you give yourself to me
                Give it all, oh
                I just wanna see
                I just wanna see how beautiful you are
                You know that I see it
                I know you're a star
                Where you go I'll follow
                No matter how far
                If life is a movie
                Oh you're the best part, oh
                Then You're the best part, ooh
                You're the best part
                It's this sunrise
                And those brown eyes, yes
                You're the one that I desire
                When we wake up
                And then we make love
                It makes me feel so nice
                You're my water when I'm stuck in the desert
                You're the Tylenol I take when my head hurts
                You're the sunshine on my life
                I just wanna see how beautiful you are
                You know that I see it
                I know you're a star
                Where you go I'll follow
                No matter how far
                If life is a movie
                Then you're the best part, oh
                You're the best part, ooh
                You're the best part
                If you love me won't you say something
                If you love me won't you
                Won't you
                If you love me won't you say something
                If you love me won't you
                Love me, won't you
                If you love me won't you say something
                If you love me won't you
                If you love me won't you say something
                If you love me won't you
                Love me, won't you
                If you love me won't you say something
                If you love me won't you
                If you love me won't you say something
                If you love me won't you
                Love me, won't you
