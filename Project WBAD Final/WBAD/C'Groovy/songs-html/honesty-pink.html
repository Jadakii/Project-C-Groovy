                She said, "Baby, I'm afraid to fall in love
                Cause what if it's not reciprocated?"
                I told her, "Don't rush girl, don't you rush
                Guess it's all a game of patience."

                She said, "What if I dive deep?
                Will you come in after me?
                Would you share your flaws with me? Let me know."
                I told her, "Thinking is all wrong
                Love will happen when it wants
                I know it hurts sometimes, but don't let it go."

                Cause I want you, I want you, I want- I want you

                She said, "What if I tell you all the things I've done?
                Would you run away from me?"
                I told her, "Baby, we all got bags full of shit that we don't want
                But I can unpack it for you, baby."

                She said, "What if I dive deep?
