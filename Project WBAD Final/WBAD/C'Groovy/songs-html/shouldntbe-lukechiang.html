                I can't stop feelin' like none of this matters at

                Fool around, tell me words that you don't mean
                I'm already numb to it
                I'm already numb to it
                Feed me lies, tear me up, break me down
                I don't wanna be playin' these games

                I'm already used to it
                I'm already used to you bein' this cold

                But keepin' you close shouldn't be hard
                If you were honest when you said you missed me
                You've played with my pride
                Makin' me feel like we had somethin' real

                I know we've been over this, it's nothin' new
                You're still gonna be leavin' me here
                It's easier hatin' you than missin' you
                But I don't wanna be feelin' this way

                I'm already through with it
                I'm already tired of thinkin' at all

                'Cause keepin' you close shouldn't be hard
                If you were honest when you said you missed me
                You've played with my pride
                Makin' me feel like we had somethin' real
                And makin' you stay shouldn't feel wrong
                This is the last time I'll ask you to listen
                I've played all my cards
                Would you feel a thing if you saw me right now?
            
                No matter what I say to you
                You're gone (I've been tryin' in vain to hold on)
                No matter what I say

                Keepin' you close shouldn't be hard
                If you were honest when you said you've missed me
                You've played with my pride
                Makin' me feel like we had somethin' real
                And makin' you stay shouldn't feel wrong
                This is the last time I'll ask you to listen
                I've played all my cards
                Would you feel a thing if you saw me right now?
