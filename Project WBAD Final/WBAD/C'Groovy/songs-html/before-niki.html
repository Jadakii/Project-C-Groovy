                You hid me in your dorm room
                It was Halloweekend, I just flew across the globe
                Twenty-two hours just to see you
                Just to barely fit on your twin-sized bed
                And talk about your cool new friend
                Who I never met, who you dated as soon as I left

                Carolina autumn
                It had been a year since I saw you
                Since we ended it
                Had a year to grow into the girl you always wanted
                Now we're holding hands as not quite friends
                But not quite lovers
                Well, we'll just pretend
                You say, "It's complicated to make amends"
                Well, is that the way that we're headed then?

                And you couldn't answer me
                Though you could pull me in while I brushed my teeth
                And let your hands both freely speak
                Like I wasn't ever gonna leave, leave

                You were all I'd ever known
                And now I'm supposed to love you from a distance
                Like it's nothing, like it's instant
                And you say, "Let's just see where this goes"
                And I don't know how or why you seem just fine
                'Cause I'm having to grasp that you're somehow not mine anymore
                It's so cruel how things are only almost like they were before

                Like they were before
                Like they were before
                Like they were before

                We walk downtown and it's charming
                You're alarmingly disarming
                Yeah, we've got forty-eight hours left
                Before I fly back to my death
                While you stay just fine and feel alive
                South of the Mason-Dixon line
                Where everyone closes shop at nine
                Where you could somehow finally find

                What you were desperately looking for
                Funny how you thought that was gonna be New York
                With our chalkboard walls and slanted floors
                Oh, we could've had that and so much more
                Ask your new lover what it's like to be given
                A real fighting chance before you wish her, "Good riddance"
                Did anything ever really count
                Or was I just a two-year practice round?

                You were all I'd ever known
                And now I'm feeling stupid, you're forbidden
                They say, yeah, we were something, too bad we were children
                Ooh, I don't know where to go
                And I don't know how or why you seem just fine
                'Cause I'm looking at you and God knows you're not mine anymore
                It's so cruel how things will never be the way they were before
                
                Like they were before
                It's almost just like how it was before
                But it's not anymore
