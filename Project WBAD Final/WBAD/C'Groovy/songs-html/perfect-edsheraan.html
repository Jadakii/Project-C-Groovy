            <div class="lyrics" id="song-lyrics" aria-label="Lyrics of the song">
                I found a love for me
                Oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
                Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
                Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me

                'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love, not knowin' what it was
                I will not give you up this time
                Oh, darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
                And in your eyes, you're holding mine

                Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
                Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
                When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
                But you heard it, "Darling, you look perfect tonight"

                Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
                She shares my dreams, I hope that someday, I'll share her home
                I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
                To carry love, to carry children of our own

                We are still kids, but we're so in love, fightin' against all odds
                I know we'll be alright this time
                Darling, just hold my hand, be my girl, I'll be your man
                I see my future in your eyes

                Oh, baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
                Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
                When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful
                I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

                No, no, no
                Mm, oh

                Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
                Barefoot on the grass, oh, listenin' to our favourite song
                I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met
                An angel in person, and she looks perfect

                Though I don't deserve this, you look perfect tonight
