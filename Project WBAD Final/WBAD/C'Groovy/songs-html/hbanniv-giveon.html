                A "heartbreak anniversary" refers to the anniversary of a painful breakup or loss, marking the date of that emotional event. It's a day when someone might reflect on the pain and grief associated with the end of a relationship or the loss of a loved one, even if years have passed. The song "Heartbreak Anniversary" by Giveon is a popular example of this concept, where the song explores the emotional toll of remembering a past love

                Ooh

                Balloons are deflated
                Guess they look lifeless like me
                We miss you on your side of the bed, mmm
                Still got your things here
                And they stare at me like souvenirs
                Don't wanna let you out my head

                Just like the day that I met you
                The day I thought forever
                Said that you love me
                But that'll last for never
                It's cold outside
                Like when you walked out my life
                Why you walk out my life?

                I get like this every time
                On these days that feel like you and me
                Heartbreak anniversary
                'Cause I remember every time
                On these days that feel like you and me
                Heartbreak anniversary
                Do you ever think of me?

                no
                (Ooh) no-no, no
                (Ooh, ooh, ooh) ooh, nah

                I'm buildin' my hopes up
                Like presents unopened 'til this day
                I still see the messages you read, mmm
                I'm foolishly patient
                (Foolishly patient)
                Can't get past the taste of your lips
                (Taste of your lips)
                Don't wanna let you out my head

                Just like the day that I met you
                The day I thought forever
                Said that you love me
                But that'll last for never
                It's cold outside
                Like when you walked out my life
                Why you walk out my life? (My life)

                I get like this every time
                On these days that feel like you and me
                Heartbreak anniversary
                'Cause I remember every time
                On these days that feel like you and me
                Heartbreak anniversary
                Do you ever think of me?

                of me
                'Cause I think of you, think of you
